### Description

Let’s practice and become familiar with classification algorithms.


### Level 1

- Exercise 1: 
  - Create at least three different classification models to try to best predict DelayedFlights.csv flight delay (ArrDelay).

- Exercise 2: 
  - Creates a new variable depending on whether the flight arrived late or not (ArrDelay> 0).

- Exercise 3: 
  - Compare classification models using accuracy, a confidence matrix, and other more advanced metrics.

- Exercise 4: 
  - Train them using the different parameters they support.  

- Exercise 5: 
  - Compare your performance using the traint / test approach or using all data (internal validation).


### Level 2

- Exercise 5: 
  - Perform some variable engineering process to improve prediction.

### Level 3

- Exercise 6: 
  - Do not use the DepDelay variable when making predictions.


### Targets

- Classification trees
- KNN - k-Nearest Neighbors
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- XGboost
